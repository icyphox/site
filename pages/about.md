![me](https://cdn.icyphox.sh/fit?url=http://files.garage.koti.lan/IMG_1570.jpg&width=1000&height=1000)

I'm Anirudh Oppiliappan. I'm building [Kapy
Cluster](https://kapycluster.com), a serverless Kubernetes platform.
From 2023-2025, I worked at UpCloud on the Managed Kubernetes team. I
currently live in Helsinki, Finland.

Below are a few things that excite me, and can serve as
conversation starters for you:

- Infrastructure and distributed systems.
- The Go programming language. I love Go and I swear by the standard
  library.
- Startups and VC.
- Motorsport. I closely follow F1, F2 and F3.
- Fitness. Strength training, calisthenics.
- (Spoken) language learning. Currently learning Finnish. Big
  fan of total immersion and comprehensible input.
- Self-hosting and homelabbing.
- Ergonomic keyboards. I like to build them. I also like to use them.
- Electric skateboarding and PEVs.
- 35mm film photography.
- Veganism, ethics and plant-based nutrition.
- Effective altruism, albeit mostly focused on animal welfare for now. I
  donate to:
  * [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org)
  * [ACE Recommended
  Charities](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/recommended-charities/)

I maintain a somewhat active list of tech that I [use](/uses).
