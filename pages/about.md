I'm Anirudh Oppiliappan, but you'll often find me as **icyphox** (or
just **icy**), on the Internet.

## contact

Send mail to [x@icyphox.sh](mailto:x@icyphox.sh) or
[anirudh@oppiliappan.com](mailto:anirudh@oppiliappan.com). Should you
need it, my [PGP key](/static/gpg.txt):

I generally always reply within the day. Alternative means of
communication, like my phone number, are only given out on a
need-to-know basis.

If you're interested in **hiring me** -- here's my
[résumé](https://x.icyphox.sh/resume.pdf).

## this site

This site is built using [vite](https://git.icyphox.sh/vite) -- a static
site generator written in Go.

Nearly all media content, barring some old images, are served from my
file host at https://x.icyphox.sh. This is hosted on my Raspberry Pi, at
home. If you notice slow image loads, this is why. At present, I have no
plans to change this setup.
